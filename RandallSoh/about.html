                    <p>
                        Hello! My Name is Randall Soh. I come from Singapore and currently living in Punggol. There are 5 people in my family inclusive of my 2 elder Siblings. I have recently graduate from Mayflower
                        Secondary School and now studying in Nanyang Polytechnic. My passion is to develop creative games and
                        to work with companies in the game development sector.

                        <p>
                            Video games are one of my favorite things to do in my free time. During my spare time in the mornings and after school, I would log in to my gaming account and play games with friends like Mobile legends and ROBLOX.
                            In today's fast-paced life, all a person does is come home from work, get up the next day, and begin working. Until the day comes when too much stress has made you stop wishing to work or earn, the loop keeps repeating.

                        <p>
                            I absolutely love watching youtube. Everyday, from morning till night, I would always go on Youtube to watch
                            video for entertainment because it helps me to relieve stress. I spent most of my free time watching youtubers
                            live stream or watching their videos regular. My favourite youtuber is, MrBeast. In his videos, he gives away money to random strangers or buys them stuff.
                            He has managed to build an unusual charity playbook that leverages his fame and skills with random acts of kindness. While he mints a ton of money himself, he doesn't keep it to himself. MrBeast, whose real name is Jimmy Donaldson, does a ton of YouTube philanthropy stunts. He gives out large sums of money away to friends, charities and the general public.

                        <p>
                            Bowling is my most favourite sport out out of the rest of the sports. It is a great activity for families, friends and parties because
                            it teaches better sportmanship and teamwork at any age. Since it is an indoor sport with air-condition, I do not have
                            to perspire and I can enjoy the cold air. In Secondary School, I chose Bowling as my first choice for the Co-curricular Activity.
                            Training was on Tuesday and Thursday from 4pm-6pm at Orchid Country Club, Yishun. I even participated in the C and B division in 2017 and 2018 respectively.

                        <p>
                            When I was Secondary School, I picked up badminton as my secondary hobby during Physical Education period. It always make me feel energetic
                            and healthy while having fun. Playing this gives me more self-esteem and self-reliant. I love playing badminton with my friends during my
                            free time. My first badminton match was when I was 8 years old. I remember during P.E class when I was learning about this game, and since then it has become my second most favourite game.

                        <p>
                            First day of school is one of my most exciting and awkward moments in my life. Stepping into the School to meet new people, getting to know
                            who is our teachers (be it kind or fierce). During that day, I had to introduce myself in front of the class about my interest, goals and myself. That is when I met my best friend who is currently
                            studying in Nanyang Polytechnic at the School of IT. The CCA selection is the most exciting for me as I can get to show off my talents and passions in order
                            to get selected first.

                        <p>
                            During the mid-term examination, I failed all of my subjects except english and literature which is only a grade 5 and the rest were Ungraded. Overall, my
                            EMB3 is 29 points which is 1 point away from retaining. It was a disaster. My teachers told me that I have a high chance of retaining if I do not take my academic seriously.
                            However, during the june holidays, I had a wake up call. I went to a tuition center called MAVIS TUTORIAL CENTER at Kovan Heartland Mall for Mathematics and Science. In the end, I managed to get a EMB3 of 19 points.

                            B Division is one of the most toughest competition for me because standards are higher than C Division. Before entering the competition, my coaches were conducting
                            a selection process to see who gets to bowl in the competition. I was selected as I bowled above average of a score of 150+ during that time. However, it took a turn for the worst.
                            During training (before competition), I did not bowl very well and was scoring 100+ which is below average. I felt that I would cause our ranking to drop so I decided to
                            give my spot to one of my CCA mates. Although it is the worst decision I ever made, but I had no regrets since I "saved" our ranking.

                            One of my most exciting and memorable moments is when I got full marks for Science(Chemistry) for the first time. I remember when I got back from school after
                            the B Division Bowling Competition at Orchid Country Club, my classmates were cheering and congratulate me which gave me confusion. During Exams, I became top in class for
                            Mathematics and Science(Chemistry) and got a EMB3 of 12 points which I am eligible for the polytechnic foundation programme (PFP). For the first time ever, I dominate the top in class for Science which brought me feelings of exuberance and I cannot forget that.
